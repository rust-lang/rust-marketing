# Feelings

* The feeling of climbing a tall mountain and enjoying the view as you climb. Passing other climbers who smile and give encouragement as you pass.

* The feeling of a group of people playing a new instrument and enthusiastically showing each other what they've learned.

* The feeling of a group of makers showing each other than anything is possible, with an ever-growing bin of reusable parts other people have made.

* The feeling of being on a precision bicycle that can go anywhere, riding in a group of other riders across a great land.

* The feeling of a mentor guiding you to become a better programmer, knowing that tomorrow your skills will have improved.
