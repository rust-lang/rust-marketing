# Rust

## Slogan

*Fearless programming. Precision engineering. Welcoming community. Reach further with Rust.*

## What is Rust?

- Rust is a programming language for writing and maintaining fast, reliable, and small-footprint code.

## Why Rust?

- Rust makes the most demanding programming tasks easier.

**You should consider Rust whenever:**

- Performance or resource usage is critical,
- Reliability or predictability is critical, or
- The environment is constrained, e.g. small devices or code embedded into other languages.

Rust is built to make this kind of programming work vastly more pleasant and productive than it's been in the past.

**Compared to other languages in this space, Rust:**

- Has top-notch tooling, including a built-in package manager (Cargo) that makes dependency management a breeze.

- Provides a strong safety net, with the compiler *guaranteeing* the absense of many classes of bugs that plague this kind of code.

- Strives to be welcoming and inclusive, empowering developers from a wide variety of backgrounds to raise their ambitions.

## Where is Rust used?

- Rust is used at hundreds of companies, including Google, Facebook, Microsoft, Twitter, Dropbox, Red Hat, npm, and Mozilla.

## When *not* to use Rust

- Rust is not a good choice for rapid prototyping or throw-away code. It trades higher initial development costs for long-run benefits.

## Who makes Rust?

- Rust is built in the open, by a worldwide team of contributors, including paid contributors from several of the companies using Rust

- Rust's official governance includes over 100 individuals on TODO teams and working groups.
